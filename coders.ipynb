    "# LMS + EMS Project Developer Guidelines & Sample App Skeleton\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Overview for Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves developing an integrated LMS + EMS system with multiple modules built separately by individual developers. Each module corresponds to a functional area (e.g., attendance, results, timetable, assignments). At the end, all modules will be integrated into a single Django project.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Key Principles for All Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistent Naming:** Follow agreed naming conventions for apps, models, views, templates, and URLs to avoid collisions.\n",
    "- **Modularity:** Each developer works on a self-contained Django app for their feature.\n",
    "- **Role-based Permissions:** Ensure views and templates respect user roles using Django's authentication and permission systems.\n",
    "- **Use Django ORM:** No direct SQL queries; use Django ORM for database operations.\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Write reusable components where possible (forms, templates, utilities).\n",
    "- **API Contracts:** If apps communicate via APIs, standardize request/response formats.\n",
    "- **Documentation:** Comment code, document API endpoints, and provide README for each app.\n",
    "- **Version Control:** Use the shared Git repository, branch per feature, and pull requests for review.\n",
    "- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle errors with user-friendly messages.\n",
    "- **Testing:** Write unit tests and integration tests for your module.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "- Follow **PEP8** coding standards.\n",
    "- Use **meaningful commit messages**.\n",
    "- Communicate frequently on progress and blockers.\n",
    "- Use Django admin for initial data entry/testing.\n",
